The Internet of Things (IoT) has been fostered by accelerated
advancements in communication technologies, computation technologies,
sensor technologies, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and
semiconductor technologies. During IoTâ€™s operations, it may collect,
transmit and process secret data, which raise security
problems. Implementing security mechanisms for ultra-low-power and
low-cost IoT devices is challenging because they are intended to be
battery-based devices with limited power budget, limited computation,
and small memory footprint. In this talk, we will summarize the
current options to secure ultra-low-power IoT applications and present
our work on cryptographic hardware for IoT and our hardware security
evaluation framework based on power estimation tools. This talk also
discusses future research directions for security for ultra-low-power
IoT applications.
