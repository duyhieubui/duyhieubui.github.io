        abstract = {Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) in combination with Supported Vector Machine (SVM) has been used as an efficient method for object detection in general and human detection in particular. Human detection using HOG-SVM in hardware shows high classification rate at higher throughput when compared with deep learning methods. However, data dependencies and complicated arithmetic in HOG feature generation and SVM classification limit the maximum throughput of these applications. In this paper, we propose a novel high-throughput hardware architecture for human detection by co-optimizing HOG feature generation and SVM classification. The throughput is improved by using a fast, highly-parallel and low-cost HOG feature generation in combination with a modified datapath for parallel computation of SVM and HOG feature normalization. The proposed architecture has been implemented in TSMC 65nm technology with a maximum operating frequency of 500MHz and throughput of 139fps for Full-HD resolution. The hardware area cost is about 145kGEs along with 110kb SRAMs.}

applied to various real-world machine learning applications.
However, performing large DNN inference tasks in real-time
remains a challenge due to its substantial computational costs. Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an alternative way of processing DNN?s task. Due to its eventbased, data-driven computation, SNN reduces both inference latency and complexity. With efficient conversion methods from traditional DNN, SNN exhibits similar accuracy, while leveraging many state-of-the-art network models and training methods. In this work, an efficient neuromorphic hardware architecture for image recognition task is presented. To preserve accuracy, the analog-to-spiking conversion algorithm is adopted. The system aims to minimize hardware area cost and power consumption, enabling neuromorphic hardware processing in edge devices. Simulation results have shown that, with the MNIST digit recognition task, the system has achieved {$\times$}20 reduction in terms
of core area cost compared to the state-of-the-art works, with an accuracy of 94.4\%, core area of 15 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m2 at a maximum frequency of 250 MHz.}

        abstract = {Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures have been recently considered as the big breakthrough for a variety of applications. Because of the high computing capabilities required, DNN has been unsuitable for various embedded applications. Many works have been trying to optimize the key operations, which are multiply-and-add, in hardware for a smaller area, higher throughput, and lower power consumption. One way to optimize these factors is to use the reduced bit accuracy; for examples, Google's TPU used only 8-bit integer operations for DNN inference. Based on the characteristics of different layers in DNN, further bit accuracy can be changed to preserve the hardware area, power consumption, and throughput. In this work, the thesis investigates a hardware implementation of multiply-and-add with variable bit precision which can be adjusted at the computation time. The proposed design can calculate the sum of several products with the bit precision ranging from 1 to 16 bits. The hardware implementation results on Xilinx FPGA Virtex 707 development kit show that our design occupies smaller hardware and can run at a higher frequency of 310 MHz, while the same functionality implemented with and without DSP48 blocks can only run at a frequency of 102 MHz. In addition, to demonstrate that the proposed design is applicable effectively for deep neural network architecture, the paper also integrated the new design in the MNIST network. The simulation and verification results show that the proposed system can achieve the accuracy up of to 88\%.}

        abstract = {Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is a popular
feature description for the purpose of object detection. However, HOG algorithm requires a performance system because of its complex operation set. Especially, the cell histogram generation is one of the most complex part, it uses inverse tangent, square, square root, floating point multiplication. In this paper, we propose an accurate and low complex cell histogram generation by bypass the gradient of pixel computation. It employs the bin?s
boundary angle method to determine the two quantized angles. However, instead of choosing an approximate value of tan, the nearest greater and the nearest smaller of each tan values from ratio between pixel?s derivative in y and x direction are used. Magnitude of two bins are solutions of a system of two equations, which represent the equality of the gradient of a pixel and its two bins in both vertical and horizontal direction. The proposed
method spends only 30 addition and 40 shift operations to identify two bins of a pixel. Simulation results show that the percentage error when reconstructing the difference in x and y direction are always less than 2\% with 8-bit length of the fractional part. Additionally, manipulating the precision of gradient magnitude is very simple by pre-defined sine and cosine values of quantized angles. Synthesizing the hardware implementation presents that
its area cost is 3.57 KGates with 45nm NanGate standard cell library. The hardware module runs at the maximum frequency of 400 MHz, and the throughput is 0.4 (pixel/ns) for a single module. It is able to support about 48 fps with 4K UHD resolution.}

As the complexity of video coding algorithm is rising, there are more demands for hardware accelerators and customized hardware. Context-based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) is the only entropy coding method adopted in the latest video compression standard, High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). Binary Arithmetic Encoder (BAE) is an essential component in CABAC, where the compression process happens. Because of the high data dependency and sequential coding characteristic, it is challenging to parallelize BAE. In this work, we proposed a low-cost and high-throughput hardware architecture for one core of BAE in HEVC. Our 4-stage pipelined BAE architecture is capable of processing one regular bin and up to 4 bypass bins per clock cycle with 30\% reduction in terms of area when compared with the designs for one-core CABAC architecture. The design can compress an average of 1.4 bins per cycle. It achieves a throughput of 1 Gbin/s at the maximum operating frequency of 810 MHz with the area of 2.2 kGEs and the power consumption of 2.0 mW in Nangate 45nm technology.}

The proposed design uses simple shift registers for key/data storage and permutation to minimize the area, and the power/energy consumption. These shift registers also minimize the control logics in the key expansion and the encryption path. The proposed architecture is further optimized for area and/or power/energy consumption by selecting a suitable implementation of S-boxes and applying the clock gating technique. The implementation results in TSMC 65nm technology show that our design can save 20\% of area or 20\% of energy per bit at the same area when compared with the current 32-bit datapath designs.

        abstract = {The bit-rate is the one the most crucial factor in storing and transmitting the digital videos while the complexity plays the most important part in embedded systems.Nowadays, H.264/AVC and newest video advance codec are great in reducing bit-rate. However, these codec have high processing dependencies and complexity. This leads to difficulties in implementing them into the embedded systems, maintaining the real time properties of the system and power consumption problems. Therefore, MJPEG  standard is still widely used in the embedded systems even it is inefficient in reducing the bit-rate. In this paper, we improve the quality and the bitrate of the MJPEG codec with low-complexity techniques: temporal compression and encoding residual values in motions.

Motion JPEG simply compresses each frame in a video sequence using JPEG still image compression standard. This video codec satisfies power consumption and real-time properties of embedded systems while having very low complexity. However, the downside is its inefficiency in reducing the bit-rate because there are still redundancies between encoded frames. In this paper, we focus on reducing temporal redundancies in MJPEG using a motion detection algorithm, called Zipfian estimation. The Zipfian estimation helps MJPEG extract separately the moving blocks and the stationary blocks then removes temporal redundancies by minimizing encoded bit-stream of stationary blocks and encoding only the residuals of the moving blocks between adjacent frames. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide twice compression ratio as much as the conventional MJPEG, and an approximate quality and bit-rate as the H.264/AVC (Intra-mode). Even the proposed method uses the Zipfian estimation, it still has smaller number of operations than the conventional MJPEG if the percentage of the static scene is equal or greater than 60\%. Compared with the H.264/AVC Intra mode when turning off the rate-distortion optimization, the running time of the proposed method is still only a half.}

One method to protect the sensitive data is using symmetric-key block cypher before and after sending
it over the network using same secret key. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is currently considered as best symmetric-key block cipher. With the block size of 128-bits and the key length starting from 128-bit up to 256-bits, AES has been proved to takes years to break. However, AES implementations in software also require more computations and time to encrypt and decrypt the data. This bottleneck not only reduces the overall system throughput but also increases the power consumption especially in the embedded system, where there are limited computations and resources. To improve the throughput and reduce the power consumption of the AES crypto system, in this work, we proposed a combined, low-cost and high-throughput AES encryption and decryption architecture supporting all key-lengths as specified in the FIPS197.
