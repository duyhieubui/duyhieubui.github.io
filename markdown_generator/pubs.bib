        abstract = {In image compression and video coding, quantization error helps to reduce the amount of information of the high frequency components. However, in temporal prediction the quantization error contributes its value as noise in the total residual information. Therefore, the residual signal of the inter-picture prediction is greater than the expected one and always differs zero value even input video contains only homogeneous frames. In this paper, we reveal negative effects of quantization errors in inter prediction and propose a video encoding scheme which is able to avoid side effects of quantization errors in the stationary parts. We propose to implement a motion detection algorithm as the first stage of video encoding to separate the video into two parts: motion and static. The motion information allows us to force residual data of non-changed part to zero and keep the residual signal of motion regularly. Beside, we design block-based filters which improve motion results and filter those results fit into block encode size well. Fixed residual data of static information permits us to pre-calculate its quantized coefficient and create a bypass encoding path for it. Experimental results with the JPEG compression (MJPEG-DPCM) showed that the proposed method produces lower bitrate than the conventional MJPEG-DPCM at the same quantization parameter and a lower computational complexity.}

        abstract = {Considering different sources of variations encountered by integrated circuits and systems today, adaptivity is a key challenge for designers. More specifically, this paper will propose different techniques, in the IoT domain, to cope with process-voltage-temperature variations as well as applicative and environmental variations. An overview of different techniques is given in the paper to be applied on gateways and also on IoT sensor nodes. Techniques like Adaptive Voltage and Frequency Scaling, adaptive imagers, wake-up radios or flexible security will be discussed. In any case, global power management is discussed in order to reach high energy efficiency and minimum energy losses while considering changing power supply environment.}

        abstract = {The increasing demand on scalability and reusability of system-on-chip design as well as the decoupling between computation and communication has motivated the growth of the Network-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm in the last decade. In NoC-based systems, the computational resources (i.e. IPs) communicate with each other using a network infrastructure. Many works have focused on the development of NoC architectures and routing mechanisms, while the interfacing between network and associated IPs also needs to be considered. In this paper, we present a novel efficient AXI (AMBA eXtensible Interface) compliant network adapter for NoC architectures, which is named an AXI-NoC adapter. The proposed network adapter achieves high communication throughput of 20.8Gbits/s and consumes 4.14mW at the operating frequency of 650MHz. It has a low area footprint (952 gates, approximate to 2,793um2 with CMOS 45nm technology) thanks to its effective hybrid micro-architectures and with zero latency thanks to the proposed mux-selection method.}

        abstract = {Connected devices are getting attention because of the lack of security mechanisms in current Internet-of-Thing (IoT) products. The security can be enhanced by using standardized and proven-secure block ciphers as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption and authentication. However, these security functions take a large amount of processing power and power/energy consumption. In this paper, we present our hardware optimization strategies for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for high speed, ultra-low power, ultra-low energy IoT applications with multiple levels of security. Our design supports multiple security levels through different key sizes, power and energy optimization for both datapath and
key expansion. The estimated power results show that our
implementation may achieve an energy per bit comparable with
the lightweight standardized algorithm PRESENT of less than
1pJ/bit at 10MHz at 0.6V with throughput of 28Mbps in ST
FDSOI 28nm technology. In terms of security evaluation, our
proposed datapath, 32-bit key out of 128 bits cannot be revealed by Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attack using less than 20 thousand traces.}

        abstract = {H.264 is the most popular video coding standard with high potent coding performance. For its efficiency, the H.264 is expected to encode real-time and/or high-definition video. However, the H.264 standard also requires highly complex and long lasting computation. To overcome these difficulties, many efforts have been deployed to increase encoding speed. Besides, with the revolution of portable devices, multimedia chips for mobile environments are more and more developed. Thus, power-oriented design for H.264 video encoders is currently a tremendous challenge. This paper discusses these trends and presents an overview of the state of the art on power features for different H.264 hardware encoding architectures. We also propose the VENGME's design, a particular hardware architecture of H.264 encoder that enables applying low-power techniques and developing power-aware ability. This low power encoder is a four-stage architecture with memory access reduction, in which, each module has been optimized. The actual total power consumption, estimated at Register-Transfer-Level (RTL), is only 19.1mW.}
